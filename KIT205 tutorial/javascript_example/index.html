        <p>
            The lively <span class="subject">brush-tailed possum</span> is one of Australia's most familiar marsupials, largely because they are highly adaptable to a wide range of natural and human environments. Their natural and preferred habitat is forest, where they nest in tree hollows. They will also cohabit with humans in cities and towns where they seek shelter, warmth and protection in the dark recesses of buildings. A favoured spot is between the ceiling and the roof and this can be a problem to some people. They can damage crops and gardens because they are partial to exotic plants, pasture grasses and vegetables as well as native plants.

        <h3>Possums in your home</h3>
        <p>
            Is that noise in the ceiling a <span class="subject">brush-tailed possum</span>? Sometimes, the intruder turns out to be an introduced rat or mouse. Sometimes both possums and rats or mice are involved and separate action is required. The following signs might help to identify the culprit.

            Rats and mice make scratching, chewing and skittering noises. They have distinctive droppings, do not defecate where they are nesting and, unlike possums, may chew electrical wiring. Rats also collect seeds and grasses, but possums do not. Possums make loud heavy, <strong>thumping</strong> sounds when walking, and distinctive guttural growls, <em>screeches</em>, hisses and coughs when disturbed. You can find out for sure by looking inside the ceiling with a flashlight during the day or observing your house just on dark when the possum emerges.
